        run: echo "Hello world"
      - name: Print goodbye
        run: echo "Done - bye"

  
If you need to run multiple shell commands (or multi-line commands, e.g., for readability), you can easily do so by adding the pipe symbol (|) as a value after the run: key.
Like this:
...
run: |
    echo "First output"
    echo "Second output"
